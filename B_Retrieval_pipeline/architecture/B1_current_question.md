# B1: Current Question - Architecture Design

## Name
**B1: Current Question**

## Purpose
Initializes the retrieval pipeline with current question data and establishes the foundation for question analysis, transformation, and concept matching processes throughout the B-series pipeline.

## Input File
- **Manual Input**: Direct question specification through script parameter or configuration
- **Contains**: User question text with optional answer and metadata for testing/validation

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/B1_current_question.json`
- **Contains**: Structured question data with metadata and processing initialization markers

## Processing Logic

### Question Data Initialization
- Captures **user question text** as primary input for downstream processing pipeline
- Generates **unique question identifier** for tracking and process correlation across pipeline stages
- Establishes **processing timestamp** for execution tracking and debugging support
- Creates **question metadata structure** including source, type hints, and processing flags

### Input Validation Framework
- Performs **question text validation** checking for non-empty content and reasonable length
- Applies **character encoding normalization** ensuring consistent text processing across pipeline
- Implements **basic question structure detection** identifying interrogative patterns and question types
- Generates **validation warnings** for potentially problematic question formats

### Pipeline Initialization Setup
- Creates **processing context** establishing question-specific processing parameters
- Initializes **pipeline state tracking** for monitoring progress through B-series stages
- Establishes **error handling context** for graceful failure recovery in downstream processes
- Sets **quality assessment baseline** for comparative analysis of processing effectiveness

### Mock Data and Testing Support
- Provides **configurable mock questions** for testing and development scenarios
- Includes **expected answer data** when available for validation and quality assessment
- Supports **batch question processing** through iterable question collection handling
- Maintains **testing metadata** including difficulty ratings and expected processing outcomes

## Key Decisions

### Question Input Strategy
- **Decision**: Support both direct parameter input and configuration-based question specification
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for both interactive use and automated testing scenarios
- **Impact**: Enables diverse usage patterns but requires input method coordination

### Identifier Generation Approach
- **Decision**: Generate timestamp-based question identifiers rather than hash-based or sequential IDs
- **Rationale**: Provides chronological ordering and debugging support through temporal correlation
- **Impact**: Enables execution timeline analysis but may not ensure uniqueness in concurrent processing

### Validation Scope Selection
- **Decision**: Apply basic text validation rather than sophisticated question quality assessment
- **Rationale**: Maintains processing speed while catching obvious input errors
- **Impact**: Provides essential error prevention but may not identify subtle question quality issues

### Mock Data Integration
- **Decision**: Include mock question data within the script rather than external test files
- **Rationale**: Ensures testing capability availability without external dependencies
- **Impact**: Provides reliable testing support but increases script complexity

### Processing Context Establishment
- **Decision**: Create comprehensive processing context rather than minimal question passing
- **Rationale**: Enables sophisticated downstream processing and debugging capabilities
- **Impact**: Provides rich processing environment but increases initialization overhead

### Metadata Structure Design
- **Decision**: Use extensible metadata structure accommodating future processing requirements
- **Rationale**: Supports pipeline evolution and additional processing features without structural changes
- **Impact**: Provides future flexibility but may include unused metadata fields initially
