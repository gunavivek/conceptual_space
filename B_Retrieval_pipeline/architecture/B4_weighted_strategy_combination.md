# B4: Weighted Strategy Combination - Architecture Design

## Name
**B4: Weighted Strategy Combination**

## Purpose
Combines results from multiple matching strategies (Intent, Declarative, Answer-Backward) using weighted integration to produce unified concept rankings that leverage the strengths of each matching approach.

## Input Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/B3_1_intent_matching_output.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/B3_2_declarative_matching_output.json`
- **Tertiary**: `outputs/B3_3_answer_backward_output.json`
- **Contains**: Individual strategy matching results with similarity scores and matching metadata

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/B4_weighted_strategy_combination.json`
- **Contains**: Combined concept rankings with weighted scores, strategy contributions, and final match recommendations

## Processing Logic

### Strategy Weight Application
- Applies **predefined strategy weights**: Intent matching (53.8%), Declarative matching (36.2%), Answer-backward (10%)
- Implements **weighted score calculation** multiplying individual strategy scores by assigned strategy weights
- Performs **score normalization** ensuring weighted scores remain within interpretable ranges (0-1)
- Maintains **strategy contribution tracking** showing individual strategy impacts on final rankings

### Cross-Strategy Match Integration
- Identifies **concepts appearing across multiple strategies** for consensus-based ranking enhancement
- Calculates **combined weighted scores** by summing weighted contributions from all participating strategies
- Applies **multi-strategy bonuses** rewarding concepts that perform well across different matching approaches
- Handles **single-strategy matches** by applying appropriate weights without penalizing unique discoveries

### Confidence Assessment Framework
- Calculates **overall matching confidence** based on strategy agreement and individual strategy confidence scores
- Measures **strategy consensus** through concept overlap analysis and score correlation assessment
- Generates **ranking stability metrics** showing sensitivity to weight variations and strategy availability
- Produces **quality indicators** combining score magnitude with strategy diversity measures

### Final Ranking Generation
- Creates **unified concept ranking** ordered by combined weighted scores from highest to lowest
- Applies **tie-breaking logic** using strategy diversity and individual strategy peak performance
- Implements **result filtering** removing concepts below minimum combined score thresholds
- Generates **recommendation tiers** (high confidence, moderate confidence, exploratory) based on score ranges

## Key Decisions

### Strategy Weighting Schema
- **Decision**: Use empirically-derived weights (Intent 53.8%, Declarative 36.2%, Answer-backward 10%) rather than equal weighting
- **Rationale**: Reflects relative effectiveness of different matching strategies based on retrieval performance analysis
- **Impact**: Optimizes overall matching quality but creates dependency on weight tuning for different domains

### Multi-Strategy Bonus Policy
- **Decision**: Apply modest bonuses (5-10%) for concepts appearing in multiple strategies rather than large multipliers
- **Rationale**: Rewards consensus while preserving individual strategy contributions and avoiding over-emphasis on common concepts
- **Impact**: Enhances consensus concepts while maintaining strategy diversity in final rankings

### Score Normalization Approach
- **Decision**: Maintain original score ranges with weight application rather than rescaling to 0-1 range
- **Rationale**: Preserves interpretability of individual strategy scores while applying appropriate relative emphasis
- **Impact**: Enables strategy-level performance analysis but requires understanding of weight-adjusted score interpretation

### Confidence Calculation Method
- **Decision**: Combine strategy consensus with individual strategy confidence rather than using weighted average only
- **Rationale**: Captures both agreement quality and individual strategy reliability for comprehensive confidence assessment
- **Impact**: Provides nuanced confidence evaluation but increases complexity of confidence interpretation

### Result Set Size Management
- **Decision**: Apply minimum score thresholds rather than fixed result counts for final recommendation sets
- **Rationale**: Ensures quality-based filtering while allowing natural variation in result set sizes based on matching success
- **Impact**: Maintains result quality standards but creates variable output sizes requiring downstream adaptation

### Missing Strategy Handling
- **Decision**: Process with available strategies and adjust weights proportionally rather than requiring all strategies
- **Rationale**: Provides operational resilience when individual strategies fail or are unavailable
- **Impact**: Maintains processing continuity but may produce inconsistent results across different execution scenarios
