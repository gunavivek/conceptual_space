# B2.3: Answer Expectation Prediction - Architecture Design

## Name
**B2.3: Answer Expectation Prediction**

## Purpose
Predicts what type of answer is expected based on question analysis to guide concept matching and answer generation by establishing format expectations and validation criteria for response quality assessment.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/B2_2_declarative_transformation_output.json`
- **Fallback**: `outputs/B2_1_intent_layer_output.json`
- **Contains**: Questions with declarative forms and intent analysis

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/B2_3_answer_expectation_output.json`
- **Contains**: Answer type predictions, format specifications, and validation criteria

## Processing Logic

### Answer Type Classification
- Detects **numeric answers** through patterns (how much/many, amount/value/number, percentages, ratios)
- Identifies **date/time answers** via temporal patterns (when did/was, what date/year, in what period)
- Recognizes **boolean answers** from yes/no question structures (is/are/do/does, can/could/will, true or false)
- Classifies **list answers** through multiple item indicators (what are the, list all, name the, which of)

### Format Specification Generation
- Determines **numeric units** (million/billion/thousand, dollars, percentages) from question context
- Sets **precision requirements** for financial (2 decimal places) and percentage (1 decimal) answers
- Identifies **date precision** needs (year, quarter, full date) based on question specificity
- Establishes **structural requirements** (simple vs comparative) for complex answer types

### Complexity Analysis Framework
- Detects **calculation requirements** through mathematical terms (total, sum, average, difference, ratio)
- Identifies **comparison needs** via comparative language (compare, versus, higher/lower, more/less)
- Recognizes **context requirements** for explanatory questions (why, because, reason, explain)
- Determines **multi-part structure** when declarative forms suggest multiple information needs

### Validation Criteria Assembly
- Creates **type-specific validation rules** matching predicted answer types with format requirements
- Establishes **content requirements** (must contain numbers, units, specific terms) for answer validation
- Sets **length expectations** (short for simple, medium for complex) based on complexity analysis
- Generates **format compliance checks** for unit presence, precision matching, and structure alignment

## Key Decisions

### Answer Type Priority System
- **Decision**: Use hierarchical type detection with numeric having highest confidence (0.8), followed by date (0.7), then boolean (0.6)
- **Rationale**: Reflects typical business document question patterns where numeric questions are most common and identifiable
- **Impact**: Provides reliable type prediction but may misclassify edge cases between numeric and text

### Pattern Matching Approach
- **Decision**: Use regex-based pattern matching rather than ML classification for answer type prediction
- **Rationale**: Ensures interpretable and maintainable type detection with domain-specific customization
- **Impact**: Provides reliable pattern recognition but requires manual pattern updates for new question types

### Format Specification Granularity
- **Decision**: Include detailed format specifications (units, precision, structure) rather than generic type labels
- **Rationale**: Enables precise answer validation and format checking for quality assessment
- **Impact**: Provides comprehensive format guidance but increases prediction complexity

### Complexity Assessment Scope
- **Decision**: Analyze complexity across multiple dimensions (calculation, comparison, context, multi-part) simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Captures various aspects of answer complexity for appropriate response generation
- **Impact**: Provides nuanced complexity understanding but may produce conflicting complexity indicators

### Validation Criteria Integration
- **Decision**: Generate specific validation criteria tied to predicted answer types and formats
- **Rationale**: Enables automated answer quality assessment and format compliance checking
- **Impact**: Provides objective answer evaluation but may be overly restrictive for creative or unexpected valid answers

### Confidence Score Calculation
- **Decision**: Use pattern match confidence as primary indicator rather than combining multiple signals
- **Rationale**: Maintains interpretable confidence scoring directly tied to pattern detection strength
- **Impact**: Provides clear confidence interpretation but may not capture prediction uncertainty from multiple competing patterns
