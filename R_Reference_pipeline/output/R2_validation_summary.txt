CONCEPT VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================================================
R-Pipeline: Resource & Reasoning Pipeline
==================================================

Total Concepts Validated: 5
Average Validation Score: 0.235
BIZBOK Coverage: 0.8%

Coverage Distribution:
  Poor: 100.0%

Domain Performance:
  Finance: 0.229
  Manufacturing: 0.263

Recommendations:
  [HIGH] Low overall validation quality (0.24) - review concept extraction strategies
  [HIGH] Low BIZBOK coverage (0.8%) - expand concept identification scope
  [MEDIUM] Poor finance domain performance (0.23) - strengthen domain-specific extraction
  [MEDIUM] Poor manufacturing domain performance (0.26) - strengthen domain-specific extraction
  [MEDIUM] 10 highly-connected concepts missing - prioritize for extraction
  [MEDIUM] More low-quality than high-quality matches - improve concept extraction precision

Critical Missing Concepts:
  - Event (government) - 67 connections
  - Schedule (government) - 48 connections
  - Standard (government) - 36 connections
