# R3: Reference Alignment - Architecture Design

## Name
**R3: Reference Alignment**

## Purpose
Aligns pipeline concepts with reference standards and creates standardized concept definitions and mappings for improved concept consistency and system-wide standardization.

## Input Files
- **Primary**: `output/R2_concept_validation_report.json`
- **Contains**: Concept validation results with similarity analysis and match recommendations

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `output/R3_reference_alignment_report.json`
- **Secondary**: `output/R3_concept_alignment_export.json`
- **Contains**: Alignment mappings, standardized concepts, and export-ready alignment data

## Processing Logic

### Alignment Classification System
- Creates **direct alignments** for high-confidence matches (≥0.7 similarity) with reference concept standardization
- Establishes **suggested alignments** for medium-confidence matches (≥0.4 similarity) requiring manual review
- Generates **custom standardizations** for unaligned concepts maintaining pipeline-specific definitions
- Implements **confidence-based routing** ensuring appropriate treatment for different alignment quality levels

### Standardized Concept Generation
- Produces **unified concept definitions** combining reference standards with pipeline-specific extensions
- Creates **merged terminology sets** integrating original terms with reference vocabularies
- Establishes **standardized naming conventions** using reference concept names where applicable
- Maintains **traceability mappings** preserving connections between original and standardized concepts

### Term Unification Framework
- Identifies **common terminology** across multiple concepts for vocabulary standardization
- Creates **term-to-concept mappings** enabling consistent terminology usage across system
- Builds **unified vocabulary indices** supporting standardized term lookup and usage
- Generates **terminology consolidation reports** showing vocabulary unification opportunities

### Alignment Quality Assessment
- Calculates **alignment success rates** across different confidence levels and business domains
- Measures **standardization effectiveness** through terminology unification and definition consistency
- Analyzes **domain-specific alignment quality** identifying systematic alignment issues
- Generates **alignment coverage metrics** showing reference concept utilization rates

## Key Decisions

### Alignment Threshold Strategy
- **Decision**: Use dual thresholds (0.7 for direct, 0.4 for suggested) rather than single alignment threshold
- **Rationale**: Balances automatic standardization with human review requirements for optimal alignment quality
- **Impact**: Maximizes automated alignment while ensuring quality control for uncertain cases

### Standardization Approach
- **Decision**: Merge reference definitions with pipeline terms rather than replacing pipeline concepts entirely
- **Rationale**: Preserves pipeline-specific insights while incorporating reference knowledge for comprehensive concepts
- **Impact**: Maintains concept richness but increases concept complexity and vocabulary size

### Custom Concept Treatment
- **Decision**: Create custom standardizations for unaligned concepts rather than marking as validation failures
- **Rationale**: Ensures all concepts receive standardized treatment while acknowledging pipeline-specific discoveries
- **Impact**: Provides complete concept coverage but may reduce standardization consistency

### Term Unification Scope
- **Decision**: Unify terminology across all concepts rather than within-domain unification only
- **Rationale**: Maximizes vocabulary consistency and enables cross-domain term standardization
- **Impact**: Improves system-wide terminology consistency but may obscure domain-specific term meanings

### Export Data Structure
- **Decision**: Create comprehensive export data including dictionaries, mappings, and hierarchies
- **Rationale**: Supports multiple downstream usage scenarios without requiring specific export format assumptions
- **Impact**: Provides flexible data utilization but increases export complexity and size

### Alignment Registry Design
- **Decision**: Maintain detailed alignment registry with confidence levels and alignment types
- **Ratational**: Enables alignment quality tracking and selective utilization based on confidence requirements
- **Impact**: Provides alignment transparency but requires registry maintenance and interpretation complexity
