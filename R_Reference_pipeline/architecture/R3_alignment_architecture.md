# R3: Reference Alignment Architecture

## Overview
**Purpose:** Create alignment mappings between pipeline concepts and BIZBOK reference standards to establish concept consistency and standardization across the conceptual space system.

**Pipeline Position:** Third stage of R-Pipeline (Resource & Reasoning Pipeline)

## Input Requirements

### Primary Inputs
1. **R2 Validation Report** - `output/R2_validation_report.json`
2. **R1 BIZBOK Concepts** - `output/R1_CONCEPTS.json`

### Data Dependencies
- **Validation Results:** 150+ validated pipeline concepts
- **BIZBOK References:** 500+ authoritative concepts
- **Quality Thresholds:** Confidence-based alignment tiers

## Processing Architecture

### 1. Three-Tier Alignment System
- **Tier 1: Direct Alignments** (≥ 0.7 confidence)
- **Tier 2: Suggested Alignments** (0.4-0.7 confidence) 
- **Tier 3: Custom Concepts** (< 0.4 confidence)

### 2. Standardization Process
- Definition standardization with authority source
- Term unification across pipeline + BIZBOK
- Domain alignment for consistency
- Quality metadata tracking

## Output Specifications

### R3_alignment_mappings.json
Complete alignment analysis with tier classifications, standardized concepts, and quality metrics.

### R3_alignment_export.json
Export-ready data for A/B pipeline integration with concept dictionary and term mappings.

## Performance Specifications
- **Processing Time:** < 2 minutes for 150 concepts
- **Memory Usage:** < 120MB peak
- **Quality:** 95%+ alignment accuracy

## Success Criteria
✅ Three-tier alignment system  
✅ Comprehensive standardization  
✅ Quality analysis and recommendations  
✅ Integration-ready exports
