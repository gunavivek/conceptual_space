# A2.2: Keyword Phrase Extraction - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.2: Keyword Phrase Extraction**

## Purpose
Extracts significant keywords and phrases from preprocessed documents using TF-IDF analysis and statistical methods to identify the most important terms for concept formation and semantic analysis.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.1_preprocessed_documents.json`
- **Contains**: Cleaned and normalized documents with domain classifications

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.2_keyword_extractions.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.2_keyword_extractions.meta.json`
- **Contains**: Document-level keyword extractions with TF-IDF scores and statistical rankings

## Processing Logic

### TF-IDF Calculation Framework
- Implements **term frequency calculation** with normalized scoring across document length variations
- Calculates **inverse document frequency** using logarithmic scaling for corpus-wide term importance
- Applies **TF-IDF weighting** combining frequency and rarity measures for term significance assessment
- Supports **domain-specific term weighting** with bonuses for domain-relevant vocabulary

### Keyword Extraction Pipeline
- Performs **n-gram generation** supporting unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for phrase extraction
- Applies **statistical filtering** removing terms below frequency and significance thresholds
- Implements **domain-aware filtering** preserving domain-specific terminology regardless of frequency
- Executes **quality-based ranking** ordering keywords by combined statistical and domain relevance scores

### Phrase Recognition System
- Identifies **multi-word expressions** through statistical co-occurrence analysis
- Detects **domain-specific phrases** using curated phrase patterns for financial, technical, and healthcare domains
- Applies **phrase coherence scoring** measuring semantic unity of multi-word terms
- Maintains **phrase-to-constituent mapping** for granular analysis and expansion opportunities

### Statistical Analysis and Ranking
- Generates **keyword importance distributions** across documents for collection-level analysis
- Calculates **domain-specific keyword concentrations** measuring specialized vocabulary density
- Provides **comparative keyword analysis** showing term importance variations across domains
- Creates **extraction quality metrics** including coverage, precision, and domain alignment measures

## Key Decisions

### TF-IDF Implementation Approach
- **Decision**: Use standard TF-IDF with domain-specific term bonuses rather than modified TF-IDF variants
- **Rationale**: Maintains interpretable and comparable scores while accommodating domain expertise
- **Impact**: Provides reliable term importance ranking with domain awareness but may not capture subtle semantic relationships

### N-gram Range Selection
- **Decision**: Support unigrams through trigrams rather than extending to longer n-grams
- **Rationale**: Balances phrase detection capability with computational efficiency and noise reduction
- **Impact**: Captures most meaningful phrases while maintaining processing speed and result interpretability

### Domain Weighting Strategy
- **Decision**: Apply multiplicative bonuses (1.2-1.5x) for domain-specific terms rather than additive bonuses
- **Rationale**: Preserves relative importance relationships while boosting domain-relevant terminology
- **Impact**: Enhances domain-specific extraction without completely overriding statistical significance

### Filtering Threshold Configuration
- **Decision**: Use configurable frequency and significance thresholds rather than fixed cutoffs
- **Rationale**: Enables adaptation to varying document collection sizes and content characteristics
- **Impact**: Provides extraction flexibility but requires threshold tuning for optimal performance

### Phrase Detection Method
- **Decision**: Combine statistical co-occurrence with curated phrase patterns rather than using purely statistical approaches
- **Rationale**: Leverages both data-driven discovery and domain expertise for comprehensive phrase extraction
- **Impact**: Improves phrase quality but requires maintenance of domain-specific phrase patterns

### Keyword Limit Policy
- **Decision**: Extract variable number of keywords based on document length and content richness rather than fixed limits
- **Rationale**: Accommodates natural variation in document information density and importance distribution
- **Impact**: Provides appropriate extraction depth for each document but creates variable output sizes
