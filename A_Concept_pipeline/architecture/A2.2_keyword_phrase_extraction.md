# A2.2: Keyword Phrase Extraction - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.2: Ensemble Business Keyword Extraction (DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC)**

## Purpose
Extracts meaningful business keywords from lemmatized tokens using an ensemble approach combining KeyBERT semantic extraction, YAKE statistical extraction, direct business term identification, and lemma reconstruction to produce domain-agnostic, complete business terms for downstream concept formation.

## Input Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.1_preprocessed_documents.json`  
- **Contains**: Preprocessed documents with lemmatized tokens, unique lemmas, POS tags, noun phrases, business terms, and cleaned text for ensemble keyword extraction

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.2_keyword_extractions.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.2_keyword_extractions.meta.json`
- **Contains**: Document-level ensemble keyword extractions with method scores, ensemble rankings, and explicit keyword_id tracking for pipeline traceability

## Processing Logic

### Stage 1: Lemmatized Input Processing (NEW)
- **Lemmatized Token Extraction**: Loads lemmatized tokens, unique lemmas, and business terms from A2.1 preprocessing
- **Business Term Seed Loading**: Extracts pre-identified business terms and noun phrases for enhanced extraction
- **Token Mapping Analysis**: Processes original→lemma mappings for keyword reconstruction capabilities
- **Document Structure Analysis**: Leverages POS tags and linguistic analysis from A2.1 for intelligent extraction

### Stage 2: Ensemble Keyword Extraction Framework (REDESIGNED)
- **KeyBERT Semantic Extraction**: Uses BERT embeddings for semantically meaningful keyword identification
- **YAKE Statistical Extraction**: Applies statistical and linguistic features for unsupervised keyword extraction
- **Direct Business Term Extraction**: Rule-based extraction using comprehensive business vocabulary (460+ terms)
- **Lemma Reconstruction**: Rebuilds meaningful terms from lemmatized tokens using token mappings
- **Method Diversity Assessment**: Tracks extraction method coverage and diversity for quality assurance

### Stage 3: Ensemble Scoring and Ranking Pipeline (NEW)
- **Weighted Ensemble Scoring**: Combines method scores with configurable weights (KeyBERT: 30%, YAKE: 25%, Direct: 30%, Reconstruct: 15%)
- **Method Diversity Bonus**: Awards additional scoring for keywords extracted by multiple methods
- **Business Term Validation**: Validates extracted keywords against comprehensive business vocabulary
- **Keyword ID Assignment**: Generates explicit keyword_id tracking for complete pipeline traceability
- **Score Normalization**: Ensures consistent scoring across different extraction methods

### Stage 4: Quality Validation and Output Generation
- **Business Relevance Filtering**: Ensures only meaningful business terms proceed to downstream processing
- **Duplicate Detection and Merging**: Consolidates similar keywords extracted by different methods
- **Score Ranking and Selection**: Ranks keywords by ensemble score and applies top-k selection
- **Method Attribution Tracking**: Maintains record of which methods contributed to each keyword
- **Quality Metrics Generation**: Calculates extraction coverage, method diversity, and validation success rates

## Key Decisions

### Ensemble Method Selection
- **Decision**: Combine KeyBERT, YAKE, Direct extraction, and Lemma reconstruction rather than relying on single method
- **Rationale**: Each method captures different aspects of keyword importance (semantic, statistical, domain-specific, linguistic)
- **Impact**: Produces more comprehensive and robust keyword extraction but increases computational complexity

### Business Vocabulary Integration
- **Decision**: Use comprehensive 460+ term business vocabulary across 5 categories rather than domain-specific dictionaries
- **Rationale**: Ensures domain-agnostic coverage of business terminology while maintaining semantic relevance
- **Impact**: Extracts meaningful business terms regardless of domain but may miss highly specialized terminology

### Lemmatization-Based Processing
- **Decision**: Process lemmatized tokens from A2.1 rather than raw text for keyword extraction
- **Rationale**: Normalizes word forms (companies→company) and reduces redundancy for cleaner keyword extraction
- **Impact**: Produces cleaner, more canonical business terms but requires upstream lemmatization processing

### Weighted Ensemble Scoring
- **Decision**: Apply configurable method weights (KeyBERT: 30%, YAKE: 25%, Direct: 30%, Reconstruct: 15%) rather than equal weighting
- **Rationale**: Balances semantic understanding, statistical significance, business relevance, and linguistic normalization
- **Impact**: Prioritizes business-relevant and semantically meaningful terms while maintaining statistical rigor

### Method Diversity Bonus Strategy
- **Decision**: Award bonus scores for keywords extracted by multiple methods rather than simple score averaging
- **Rationale**: Keywords identified by multiple approaches are more likely to be genuinely important
- **Impact**: Promotes consensus-based keyword selection but may favor common terms over specialized ones

### Explicit Keyword ID Tracking
- **Decision**: Generate unique keyword_id for each extracted keyword rather than relying on term strings
- **Rationale**: Enables precise traceability through pipeline stages and supports advanced analytics
- **Impact**: Provides complete pipeline tracking capability but adds complexity to data structures

## Ensemble Extraction Results (Production)

### Processing Statistics (Test Dataset)
- **Documents Processed**: 5 documents with full ensemble extraction
- **Lemmatized Tokens Processed**: Complete token vocabularies from A2.1 preprocessing
- **Business Terms Identified**: 460+ term vocabulary applied across all extraction methods
- **Method Coverage**: KeyBERT, YAKE, Direct, and Reconstruct methods applied to all documents
- **Keyword ID Assignment**: Complete traceability through explicit keyword_id generation

### Ensemble Extraction Performance
- **Quality Transformation**: Dramatic improvement from statistical noise ("$53.2", "million.") to meaningful business terms
- **Business Relevance**: High-scoring keywords show strong business semantic meaning ("deferred income", "contract balances")
- **Method Diversity**: Successful extraction across multiple methods with consensus-based ranking
- **Example Results**: "Deferred Income & Non-Current Deferred Income", "Contract Balances & Balance", "Revenue & Unearned Revenue"

### Method Performance Analysis
- **KeyBERT Semantic Extraction**: Provides semantic context and meaning-based keyword identification
- **YAKE Statistical Extraction**: Successfully identifies statistically significant business terms
- **Direct Business Extraction**: Captures domain-relevant terminology through vocabulary matching
- **Lemma Reconstruction**: Rebuilds meaningful terms from normalized linguistic forms

### Business Term Validation Impact
**Comprehensive Business Vocabulary Coverage:**
- **Financial Terms**: "revenue", "income", "asset", "liability", "deferred", "balance", "account"
- **Operational Terms**: "process", "operation", "management", "system", "service", "customer"

**Example: Financial Document Keyword Evolution:**
```
Before (TF-IDF Statistical): ["$53.2", "million.", "25.", "2019", "2018"]
After (Ensemble Business): ["deferred income", "contract balances", "revenue recognition", "financial reporting"]
```

    \"\"\"Validate keyword against comprehensive business vocabulary\"\"\"
    return (
        keyword.lower() in business_vocab or
        any(business_term in keyword.lower() for business_term in business_vocab) or
        keyword.lower().endswith(('ing', 'tion', 'ment', 'ness', 'ity'))  # Business suffixes
    )
```
