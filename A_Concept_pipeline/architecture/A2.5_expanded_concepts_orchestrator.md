# A2.5: Expanded Concepts Orchestrator - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.5: Expanded Concepts Orchestrator**

## Purpose
Orchestrates and combines results from all concept expansion strategies using weighted integration to create unified expanded concept vocabularies with quality assessments and strategic contribution analysis.

## Input Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.5.1_semantic_expansion.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.5.2_domain_expansion.json`
- **Tertiary**: `outputs/A2.5.3_hierarchical_expansion.json`
- **Quaternary**: `outputs/A2.5.4_frequency_expansion.json`
- **Quinary**: `outputs/A2.5.5_contextual_expansion.json`
- **Contains**: Individual strategy expansion results with terms, scores, and metadata

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.5_expanded_concepts.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.5_expansion_summary.json`
- **Contains**: Unified expanded concepts with weighted terms, quality scores, and orchestration metadata

## Processing Logic

### Strategy Weight Application
- Applies **predefined strategy weights**: Semantic (25%), Domain (30%), Hierarchical (20%), Frequency (15%), Contextual (10%)
- Implements **weighted term integration** where each term receives cumulative weight from contributing strategies
- Calculates **overall term significance** through weighted summation across all contributing strategies
- Maintains **strategy contribution attribution** for expansion provenance and analysis

### Dynamic Strategy Execution
- Attempts **automatic strategy execution** for missing expansion results using importlib module loading
- Implements **graceful degradation** when strategy results are unavailable or execution fails
- Provides **fallback processing** using available strategies while noting missing contributions
- Ensures **consistent orchestration** regardless of individual strategy availability

### Quality Score Integration
- Combines **expansion ratios** from individual strategies using weighted averages
- Integrates **strategy diversity scores** measuring contribution breadth across expansion approaches
- Calculates **average term weights** reflecting term importance across multiple strategies
- Generates **overall quality scores** combining expansion ratio, diversity, and average weight metrics

### Comprehensive Concept Assembly
- Aggregates **all expanded terms** from contributing strategies into unified vocabularies
- Maintains **weighted term mappings** showing cumulative importance from strategy contributions
- Preserves **original concept metadata** while augmenting with expansion-derived information
- Creates **strategy contribution summaries** detailing each strategy's expansion contributions

## Key Decisions

### Strategy Weighting Schema
- **Decision**: Use domain knowledge (30%), semantic similarity (25%), hierarchical (20%), frequency (15%), contextual (10%)
- **Rationale**: Prioritizes domain expertise and semantic relationships while balancing statistical and contextual approaches
- **Impact**: Emphasizes high-quality expansion sources while maintaining comprehensive coverage

### Dynamic Execution Strategy
- **Decision**: Attempt automatic execution of missing strategies rather than requiring pre-execution
- **Rationale**: Provides seamless orchestration experience and handles execution dependencies automatically
- **Impact**: Increases processing robustness but adds execution complexity and potential failure points

### Quality Assessment Framework
- **Decision**: Combine multiple quality dimensions rather than using single metric
- **Rationale**: Captures different aspects of expansion quality for comprehensive assessment
- **Impact**: Provides nuanced quality evaluation but requires interpretation of multi-dimensional scores

### Term Weight Accumulation
- **Decision**: Use additive weighting where terms receive cumulative weights from multiple strategies
- **Rationale**: Rewards terms that appear across multiple strategies as higher-confidence expansions
- **Impact**: Naturally promotes consensus terms but may underweight strategy-specific valuable terms

### Orchestration Completeness
- **Decision**: Process with available strategies rather than requiring all strategies to complete
- **Rationale**: Ensures orchestration can proceed despite individual strategy failures or unavailability
- **Impact**: Provides operational resilience but may produce inconsistent results across executions

### Strategy Attribution Preservation
- **Decision**: Maintain detailed strategy contribution records for each concept
- **Rationale**: Enables expansion analysis and strategy performance evaluation
- **Impact**: Provides valuable metadata for optimization but increases output complexity and size
