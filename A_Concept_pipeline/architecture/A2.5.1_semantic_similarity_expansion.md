# A2.5.1: Semantic Similarity Expansion Strategy - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.5.1: Semantic Similarity Expansion Strategy**

## Purpose
Expands core concepts using semantic similarity relationships to identify related concepts through keyword overlap, domain alignment, and thematic connections, enriching the concept vocabulary for improved retrieval.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.4_core_concepts.json`
- **Contains**: Core concepts with importance scores, primary keywords, and domain classifications

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.5.1_semantic_expansion.json`
- **Contains**: Semantic similarity expansions with similarity scores, expanded keywords, and coherence metrics

## Processing Logic

### Similarity Calculation Framework
- Implements **Jaccard similarity** as base metric for keyword set comparison
- Applies **domain alignment bonus** (0.2 boost) for concepts sharing same domain classification
- Includes **thematic similarity scoring** (0.1 boost) based on theme name word overlap
- Caps final similarity at 1.0 to maintain normalized scoring range

### Concept Expansion Process
- Identifies **similar concepts** using configurable threshold (default 0.4) for minimum similarity
- Limits expansion to **top 5 most similar concepts** per target concept to control vocabulary growth
- Aggregates **expanded keywords** with similarity-weighted inclusion criteria
- Maintains **domain relationship tracking** for cross-domain concept connections

### Keyword Integration Strategy
- Includes **all keywords** from high-similarity concepts (similarity > 0.6)
- Selects **top 3 keywords only** from medium-similarity concepts (0.4-0.6 range)
- Preserves **original concept keywords** as expansion foundation
- Eliminates **duplicate keywords** while maintaining expansion attribution

### Quality Assessment
- Calculates **semantic coherence** as average similarity score across all expansions
- Measures **expansion strength** by counting successful similar concept matches
- Tracks **document coverage expansion** through aggregated related document sets
- Generates **domain relationship statistics** for cross-domain expansion analysis

## Key Decisions

### Similarity Threshold Selection
- **Decision**: Use 0.4 as minimum similarity threshold for concept inclusion
- **Rationale**: Balances expansion breadth with semantic relevance to avoid noise
- **Impact**: Ensures expanded concepts maintain meaningful relationship to original concept

### Domain Bonus Weighting
- **Decision**: Apply 0.2 similarity bonus for same-domain concepts
- **Rationale**: Domain-specific concepts often share specialized vocabulary requiring encouragement
- **Impact**: Improves domain-specific concept expansion while allowing cross-domain connections

### Expansion Limit Strategy
- **Decision**: Limit to top 5 similar concepts per expansion
- **Rationale**: Controls vocabulary explosion while capturing primary semantic relationships
- **Impact**: Maintains processing efficiency and prevents concept dilution

### Keyword Selection Criteria
- **Decision**: Use similarity-based thresholds for keyword inclusion (high-sim: all, med-sim: top 3)
- **Rationale**: Quality-based filtering ensures most relevant terms are preserved
- **Impact**: Balances vocabulary richness with semantic precision

### Coherence Measurement
- **Decision**: Calculate coherence as average similarity score across expansions
- **Rationale**: Provides interpretable quality metric for expansion effectiveness
- **Impact**: Enables quality-based filtering and optimization in downstream processing

### Cross-Domain Expansion
- **Decision**: Allow cross-domain expansion with reduced weighting
- **Rationale**: Enables discovery of interdisciplinary concept relationships
- **Impact**: Improves concept network completeness while maintaining domain focus
