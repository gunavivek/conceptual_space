# A2.59: Review Expanded Concepts - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.59: Review Expanded Concepts**

## Purpose
Reviews and validates the quality of expanded concepts from A2.5 orchestrator using comprehensive quality metrics, identifying problematic expansions and generating improvement recommendations for concept expansion optimization.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.5_expanded_concepts.json`
- **Contains**: Orchestrated expanded concepts with strategy contributions and quality scores

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.59_concept_review_report.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.59_concept_review_summary.txt`
- **Contains**: Detailed quality analysis, problematic concept identification, and improvement recommendations

## Processing Logic

### Individual Concept Quality Analysis
- Evaluates **expansion appropriateness** using expansion ratio optimization (1-2x original size ideal)
- Assesses **strategy diversity** measuring contribution from multiple expansion strategies (target 80% of available strategies)
- Analyzes **term quality** through stop word filtering and minimum length requirements
- Calculates **coherence metrics** based on term frequency across multiple contributing strategies

### Quality Component Integration
- Combines **expansion appropriateness** (20% weight), **strategy diversity** (20% weight), **term quality** (20% weight), **coherence** (20% weight), and **orchestrator quality score** (20% weight)
- Generates **overall quality ratings**: Excellent (≥0.8), Good (≥0.6), Fair (≥0.4), Poor (<0.4)
- Creates **improvement recommendations** based on quality component deficiencies
- Tracks **strategy-specific contributions** for targeted optimization guidance

### Coverage and Distribution Analysis
- Analyzes **quality distribution** across entire concept collection for population-level assessment
- Measures **strategy coverage** showing utilization rates for each expansion strategy
- Calculates **expansion ratio statistics** including min, max, and average expansion factors
- Identifies **unused concepts** and **over-utilized concepts** for balance optimization

### Problematic Concept Identification
- Flags concepts with **quality scores below threshold** (default 0.4) for detailed review
- Identifies **expansion ratio outliers** (too small <1.0 or too large >3.0) requiring attention
- Detects **low strategy diversity** (<60% strategy participation) indicating expansion gaps
- Generates **specific improvement actions** for each identified problematic concept

## Key Decisions

### Quality Scoring Framework
- **Decision**: Use equal weighting (20% each) across five quality components
- **Rationale**: Balances multiple expansion quality aspects without over-emphasizing single dimension
- **Impact**: Provides comprehensive quality assessment but may not reflect domain-specific priorities

### Quality Threshold Selection
- **Decision**: Set problematic concept threshold at 0.4 quality score
- **Rationale**: Identifies bottom 40% quality range while maintaining reasonable review scope
- **Impact**: Focuses review effort on concepts needing improvement without overwhelming analysis

### Expansion Ratio Optimization
- **Decision**: Target 1-2x original vocabulary size as optimal expansion
- **Rationale**: Balances vocabulary enrichment with semantic focus to avoid concept dilution
- **Impact**: Provides clear expansion guidance but may not suit all concept types equally

### Strategy Diversity Measurement
- **Decision**: Measure diversity as percentage of available strategies contributing to concept
- **Rationale**: Encourages broad strategy utilization for robust expansion coverage
- **Impact**: Promotes expansion robustness but may not account for strategy quality differences

### Coherence Calculation Method
- **Decision**: Base coherence on term frequency across multiple strategies
- **Rationale**: Terms appearing in multiple strategies likely have stronger semantic relationships
- **Impact**: Rewards consensus terms but may undervalue strategy-specific valuable contributions

### Recommendation Generation Approach
- **Decision**: Generate specific recommendations based on quality component deficiencies
- **Rationale**: Provides actionable guidance for concept expansion improvement
- **Impact**: Enables targeted optimization but requires manual interpretation and action
