# A2.3: Intra-Document Keyword Clustering - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.3: Intra-Document Keyword Clustering (BUSINESS THEME-FOCUSED)**

## Purpose
Clusters related keywords within each document to form coherent business themes using semantic similarity analysis, enabling the identification of business concepts through keyword relationship analysis with explicit keyword_id tracking for complete pipeline traceability.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.2_keyword_extractions.json`
- **Contains**: Document-level ensemble keyword extractions with method scores, ensemble rankings, and explicit keyword_id tracking from the enhanced A2.2 business extraction pipeline

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.3_concept_grouping_thematic.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.3_concept_grouping_thematic.meta.json`
- **Contains**: Intra-document keyword clusters organized by business themes with keyword_id mappings, cluster coherence scores, and thematic cluster statistics per document

## Processing Logic

### Stage 1: Document-Level Keyword Collection (NEW)
- **Intra-Document Focus**: Processes keywords within each individual document separately
- **Keyword ID Preservation**: Maintains explicit keyword_id tracking from A2.2 ensemble extraction
- **Business Term Validation**: Leverages improved keyword quality from ensemble business extraction
- **Document Isolation**: Each document's keywords are clustered independently to identify document-specific themes

### Stage 2: Semantic Similarity Calculation (ENHANCED)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Creates vector representations of keywords using document context
- **Cosine Similarity Measurement**: Calculates semantic similarity between keyword pairs within documents
- **Business Context Weighting**: Leverages ensemble scores from A2.2 for enhanced similarity calculation
- **Similarity Threshold**: Uses configurable threshold (default: 0.3) for meaningful keyword relationships

### Stage 3: Agglomerative Clustering Pipeline (DOCUMENT-SCOPED)
- **Within-Document Clustering**: Groups semantically related keywords within individual documents
- **Iterative Merging**: Uses agglomerative approach to build clusters from individual keywords
- **Cluster Coherence Scoring**: Calculates average similarity within clusters for quality assessment
- **Theme Boundary Detection**: Identifies natural thematic boundaries based on keyword relationships

### Stage 4: Business Theme Identification (NEW)
- **Descriptive Theme Naming**: Generates business-relevant theme names from top keywords in each cluster
- **Keyword Representative Selection**: Identifies most representative keywords within each theme cluster
- **Business Context Integration**: Leverages ensemble extraction quality for improved theme interpretation
- **Theme Validation**: Ensures themes contain meaningful business concepts rather than statistical noise

### Stage 5: Explicit Keyword ID Mapping (TRACEABILITY)
- **Keyword ID Preservation**: Maintains complete keyword_id tracking from A2.2 through clustering
- **Cluster-to-Keyword Mapping**: Creates explicit mappings between clusters and constituent keyword_ids
- **Document-Cluster Hierarchy**: Establishes clear Doc_ID → Cluster_ID → Keyword_ID relationships
- **Pipeline Traceability**: Enables complete tracking of keywords from extraction through clustering to concept formation

### Stage 6: Quality Assessment and Statistics
- **Cluster Quality Metrics**: Calculates coherence scores, keyword distribution, and theme diversity
- **Document-Level Statistics**: Tracks clusters per document, keywords per cluster, and theme coverage
- **Business Relevance Assessment**: Measures the business semantic quality of formed themes
- **Cross-Document Analysis**: Provides corpus-level statistics while maintaining document-specific clustering

## Key Decisions

### Intra-Document vs Cross-Document Clustering
- **Decision**: Perform keyword clustering within individual documents rather than across the entire corpus
- **Rationale**: Each document represents distinct business contexts that should be analyzed independently
- **Impact**: Preserves document-specific business themes and enables fine-grained concept identification

### Semantic Similarity Method
- **Decision**: Use cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors rather than Jaccard similarity on keyword sets
- **Rationale**: Better captures semantic relationships between business keywords from ensemble extraction
- **Impact**: More nuanced clustering of business concepts with improved theme coherence

### Keyword ID Tracking Integration
- **Decision**: Maintain explicit keyword_id tracking throughout clustering process
- **Rationale**: Enables complete pipeline traceability and supports advanced analytics in downstream stages
- **Impact**: Provides granular tracking capability but requires careful data structure management

### Threshold Configuration Strategy
- **Decision**: Use configurable similarity threshold (0.3 default) rather than fixed clustering parameters
- **Rationale**: Accommodates varying document types and keyword densities from diverse business domains
- **Impact**: Provides clustering flexibility while maintaining consistent quality across document types

### Business Theme Focus
- **Decision**: Optimize clustering for business theme identification rather than general semantic grouping
- **Rationale**: Leverages improved keyword quality from A2.2 ensemble extraction for business-relevant themes
- **Impact**: Produces themes aligned with business concepts rather than statistical correlations

### Document Processing Independence
- **Decision**: Process each document's keywords independently rather than using corpus-wide clustering
- **Rationale**: Preserves document-specific business contexts and themes without cross-document interference
- **Impact**: Enables document-specific theme analysis while maintaining computational efficiency

## Enhanced Data Schema

### Document Cluster Structure
```json
{
  "doc_id": "document_identifier",
  "cluster_count": "integer",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": "integer", 
      "theme_name": "Business Theme Description",
      "keywords": [
        {
          "keyword_id": "unique_identifier",
          "term": "business_keyword",
          "score": "ensemble_score_from_A2.2"
        }
      ],
      "keyword_ids": ["array_of_keyword_ids"],
      "avg_tfidf_score": "float",
      "cluster_coherence": "float",
      "representative_keywords": ["top_theme_keywords"]
    }
  ],
  "doc_cluster_keyword_mapping": {
    "cluster_1": ["keyword_id_list"],
    "cluster_2": ["keyword_id_list"]
  }
}
```

### Keyword ID Traceability Chain
```
A2.2: keyword_id generated → A2.3: keyword_id preserved in clusters → A2.4: keyword_id available for concept synthesis
```

## Current Implementation Status

### Processing Results (Production Dataset)
- **Documents Processed**: 5 documents with complete intra-document keyword clustering

    doc_keywords = extract_doc_keywords(doc["keywords"])  # Get keywords with keyword_ids
    similarity_matrix = calculate_similarity_matrix(doc_keywords)
    clusters = perform_clustering(doc_keywords, similarity_matrix)
    themes = generate_business_themes(clusters)
    doc["clusters"] = preserve_keyword_id_mapping(themes)  # Maintain traceability
```
