# A2.5.2: Domain Knowledge Expansion Strategy - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.5.2: Domain Knowledge Expansion Strategy**

## Purpose
Expands concepts using domain-specific knowledge and ontologies to leverage specialized vocabularies and established relationships within knowledge domains, enhancing concept coverage through expert-curated term associations.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.4_core_concepts.json`
- **Contains**: Core concepts with domain classifications and primary keywords

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.5.2_domain_expansion.json`
- **Contains**: Domain-based expansions with ontology mappings, cross-domain connections, and expansion metrics

## Processing Logic

### Domain Ontology Framework
- Maintains **curated ontology dictionaries** for finance, healthcare, technology, and general domains
- Maps **base terms to expansion vocabularies** using expert-defined relationships
- Implements **hierarchical term relationships** with parent-child concept structures
- Supports **fuzzy matching** for partial term overlap within ontology structures

### Expansion Discovery Process
- Performs **direct ontology lookup** for exact keyword matches within domain vocabularies
- Executes **fuzzy relationship matching** to identify partial matches and related terms
- Falls back to **general domain ontology** when domain-specific matches are insufficient
- Aggregates **all discovered terms** while eliminating duplicates and maintaining attribution

### Cross-Domain Connection Analysis
- Identifies **keyword overlap patterns** between concepts across different domains
- Calculates **connection strength** based on shared keyword frequency and domain distance
- Maps **interdisciplinary relationships** for concepts spanning multiple knowledge domains
- Tracks **domain bridge concepts** that facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer

### Quality Measurement Framework
- Calculates **expansion ratio** as expanded terms divided by original terms
- Measures **domain coverage** as percentage of original terms found in domain ontologies
- Assesses **cross-domain connectivity** through shared keyword analysis between domain pairs
- Generates **expansion effectiveness scores** combining ratio, coverage, and connectivity metrics

## Key Decisions

### Ontology Curation Strategy
- **Decision**: Use manually curated domain ontologies rather than automated extraction
- **Rationale**: Ensures high-quality, expert-validated term relationships and reduces noise
- **Impact**: Provides reliable expansion quality but requires ongoing ontology maintenance

### Domain Hierarchy Structure
- **Decision**: Organize ontologies by primary domain with general fallback
- **Rationale**: Aligns with natural knowledge organization while providing universal coverage
- **Impact**: Enables domain-specific precision with broad applicability

### Fuzzy Matching Implementation
- **Decision**: Use substring and prefix/suffix matching for term relationship discovery
- **Rationale**: Captures morphological relationships and term variations within domains
- **Impact**: Increases expansion coverage while maintaining semantic relevance

### Cross-Domain Analysis Scope
- **Decision**: Analyze all domain pairs for cross-connections rather than limiting scope
- **Rationale**: Maximizes discovery of interdisciplinary relationships and knowledge bridges
- **Impact**: Comprehensive relationship mapping at cost of processing complexity

### Expansion Term Limits
- **Decision**: No hard limits on expansion terms, filtered only by ontology presence
- **Rationale**: Domain expertise should guide expansion rather than arbitrary numerical constraints
- **Impact**: Allows comprehensive domain coverage but may require downstream filtering

### Fallback Strategy Design
- **Decision**: Use general domain ontology when specific domain matches are insufficient
- **Rationale**: Ensures all concepts receive some level of expansion even in sparse domains
- **Impact**: Maintains consistent expansion coverage across varying domain concept densities
