# A2.1: Preprocess Document Analysis - Architecture Design

## Name
**A2.1: Preprocess Document Analysis**

## Purpose
Preprocesses documents for keyword extraction through text cleaning, normalization, and structural analysis to prepare content for optimal concept identification and semantic analysis.

## Input File
- **Primary**: `outputs/A1.2_domain_detection_output.json`
- **Contains**: Documents with domain classifications and original text content

## Output Files
- **Primary**: `outputs/A2.1_preprocessed_documents.json`
- **Secondary**: `outputs/A2.1_preprocessed_documents.meta.json`
- **Contains**: Cleaned and normalized documents with preprocessing statistics and quality metrics

## Processing Logic

### Text Cleaning Pipeline
- Implements **multi-stage text normalization** including whitespace standardization and encoding cleanup
- Applies **punctuation handling** preserving sentence boundaries while removing noise characters
- Performs **case normalization** with strategic preservation of proper nouns and acronyms
- Executes **special character processing** handling currency symbols, percentages, and numerical formatting

### Content Structure Analysis
- Identifies **sentence boundaries** using linguistic pattern recognition for proper text segmentation
- Detects **paragraph structures** for maintaining document organization during processing
- Recognizes **numerical content** including financial figures, dates, and statistical values
- Extracts **formatting indicators** such as headers, lists, and emphasis markers

### Linguistic Preprocessing
- Applies **stop word filtering** using domain-aware stop word lists with contextual preservation
- Implements **basic stemming** for morphological normalization while preserving domain terminology
- Performs **token standardization** ensuring consistent word boundary detection
- Maintains **original text mapping** for traceability between processed and source content

### Quality Assessment Framework
- Calculates **content density metrics** measuring information richness after preprocessing
- Evaluates **vocabulary diversity** through unique word ratio analysis
- Assesses **structural quality** based on sentence length distribution and paragraph organization
- Generates **preprocessing impact statistics** comparing original versus processed content characteristics

## Key Decisions

### Text Normalization Scope
- **Decision**: Apply conservative normalization preserving domain-specific terminology and formatting
- **Rationale**: Maintains semantic precision for specialized domains while enabling consistent processing
- **Impact**: Preserves important domain context but may retain some processing noise

### Stop Word Strategy
- **Decision**: Use domain-aware stop word lists rather than universal stop word removal
- **Rationale**: Preserves contextually important words that may be generic in general text but significant in specific domains
- **Impact**: Improves domain-specific keyword extraction but increases vocabulary complexity

### Sentence Segmentation Approach
- **Decision**: Implement pattern-based sentence boundary detection rather than ML-based segmentation
- **Rationale**: Provides interpretable and maintainable segmentation with domain-specific customization
- **Impact**: Ensures reliable sentence detection but may miss complex boundary cases

### Numerical Content Preservation
- **Decision**: Preserve numerical formatting and context rather than abstracting numbers
- **Rationale**: Financial and quantitative content relies heavily on specific numerical values for meaning
- **Impact**: Maintains quantitative precision but increases preprocessing complexity

### Original Text Mapping
- **Decision**: Maintain bidirectional mapping between original and processed text
- **Rationale**: Enables traceability for debugging and source content recovery when needed
- **Impact**: Provides valuable debugging capability but increases memory and storage requirements

### Quality Metric Selection
- **Decision**: Focus on content density and vocabulary diversity as primary quality indicators
- **Rationale**: These metrics effectively capture preprocessing impact on downstream concept extraction
- **Impact**: Provides meaningful quality assessment but may not capture all preprocessing effects
